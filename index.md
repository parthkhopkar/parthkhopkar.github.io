Hello there! I am Parth Khopkar, an ML Engineer at Micron where I am working on making Machine Learning inference faster and more efficient. Previously, I was involved in researching how multi-agent AI can help humans with complex and dangerous tasks such as search and rescue at at Arizona State University. Read more about my work [here](https://furi.engineering.asu.edu/participant/khopkar-parth/) or take a look at my [thesis](https://hdl.handle.net/2286/R.2.N.161716) for details.

I like to automate things and bring order to chaos. Trying to get my code to do exactly as I want by reading more and more fills up most of my days.

I will be more than happy to talk to you if you reach out to me via [email](mailto:parth.khopkar@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/parthkhopkar)
