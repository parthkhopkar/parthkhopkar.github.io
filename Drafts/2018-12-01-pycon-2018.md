#PyCon India 2018

They say, "Never meet your idols, you are bound to be disappointed". What if you meet people that you never knew about and discovered that they were your idols all along? 

This is the experience I had at PyCon India 2018, my first international tech conference. This 2 day conference was filled with talks, keynotes and the oh so delicious food, courtesy Hyderabad International Convention Centre and Hotel Novotel. What I enjoy the most about being at such a place is the vibe you get when everybody around you has a shared passion for something which in this case was **{INSERT WITTY DESCRIPTION}** Python. 

For someone who was new to the conference scene, it is not everyday that you get to meet
