#PyCon India 2018

It is said, "Never meet your idols, you are bound to be disappointed". What if you meet people that you never knew about and discovered that they were your idols all along? This is the experience I had at PyCon India 2018, my first international tech conference. This 2 day conference hosted at Hyderabad International Convention Center was a jam packed event of all things Python. 

Hyderabad, a city which combines two things that I absolutely love - Technology and a passion for Biryani, promised to be an amazing experience and it certainly was. Entering the convention center on Day 1, seeing people queued up to get their IDs, waiting for the doors to open was exactly as I had imagined. I spent most of my time trying to decide which of the three tracks to join for every talk. After scrupulously evaluating the description of each talk, the profile of the author and still wishing that I could be at three places simultaneously, I scurried from one hall to another in hopes of finding front row seats which were mostly dashed. The talks covered a multitude of topics such as effective visualization of multidimensional data and Alexa programming through Python. The one that I absolutely loved? Animation using Python. It is amazing to know that Python has permeated even the animation industry where it used to generate 3D landscapes and what not. 

At the end of the day, just before the keynote there was an hour long space for 5 minute lightning talks, most of which felt even better than what I had heard during the day. They were about brilliant projects such as using brain waves to control a rover or how a person created an AI to play Minesweeper, which topped the global rankings. 
 
The real gems were the keynotes delivered by my hitherto unknown idols. The first, a keynote delivered by Armin Ronacher (the creator of Flask) titled, "A Future Python" was not what most of us expected. Armin talked about the many chinks in Python's armor, how they can be repaired and what the Python community can learn from Rust, the world's most loved programming language according to StackOverflow 2018 Survey results.

Hearing Sidu Ponappa(the CTO of Go-Jek) felt as if I was listening to Satya Nadella and not just because of the looks. Giving deep insights on similarity between technology and organisations, talking about being a developer who is now a manager and dishing out software development truisms, this keynote was an absolute show stealer.      

Conferences like these make you feel that you are indeed part of a big global community. It is the physical manifestation for all the discussion boards, forums, tutorials and articles that one reads on the Internet.  

PyCon 2018 was a satisfying experience, foodwise too.
